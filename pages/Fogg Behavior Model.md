    - The model applies to all human behavior[^1]
        - Behaviors look different, but the core mechanisms are the same.[^2]
    - The easier a behavior is to do, the more likely the behavior will become habit.[^5]
    - Behaviors that ultimately become habits will reliably fall above the Action Line.[^3]
    - No behavior happens without a prompt.[^4]
- A behavior happens when the three elements of MAP come together at the same moment

- Three Steps for Troubleshooting a Behavior:[^6]
  Notice that fussing around with motivation is the last step in the troubleshooting order.
    - 1. Check to see if thereâ€™s a prompt to do the behavior.
    - 2. See if the person has the ability to do the behavior.
    - 3. See if the person is motivated to do the behavior.
