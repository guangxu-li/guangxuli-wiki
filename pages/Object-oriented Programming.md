- Principles
    - Programming to an **Interface**, not an **Implementation**.[1]([[647a0086-aaf0-4b08-ab57-e95385dd6082]])
        - Don't declare variables to be instances of particular concrete classes. Instead, commit only to an interface defined by an abstract class.[2]([[647a00b6-9fbb-4c71-a5a0-d8a2e6e5647d]])
    - Favor object composition over class inheritance.[3]([[647a03fd-de03-4283-bd75-a163fa5b5e9d]])
        - Inheritance
            - **white-box reuse:**
                - internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses.[4]([[647a0290-4c9f-4ced-a31a-bc0fedf10b17]])
            - Pros:
                - defined statically at compile-time and easy to use
                - easy to modify the implementation being reused
            - Cons:
                - can't change the implementation inherited from parent classes at run-time
                - inheritance breaks encapsulation
                    - because inheritance exposes a subclass to details of its parent's implementation
        - Composition
            - **black-box reuse:**[5]([[647a029c-9571-4ee0-bab7-96f448d5d0c3]])
                - Object composition requires that the objects being composed have well-defined interfaces.
                - No internal details of objects are visible.
                - Objects appear only as "black boxes".
            - Pros:
                - composition don't break encapsulation
                    - because objects are accessed solely through their interfaces
                - any object can be replaced at runtime by another as long as it has the same type
                - helps to keep each class encapsulated and focused on one task
            - Cons:
                - Dynamic, highly parameterized software is harder to understand than more static software.

        - Delegation is way of making composition as powerful for reuse as inheritance.[6]([[647a04cf-824b-4ada-a289-8f1a6fef7f11]])
            - ((647a0af0-f552-4651-b6dc-b274ec3a9525))
            - Pros:
                - easy to compose behaviors at runtime
            - Cons:
                - ((647a0b2a-bb4d-42f5-b360-0c1ab2ce15dd))
