- About
    - [Guangxu Li](https://guangxuli.com/about), a Software Engineer and Bug-oriented programming master, stood amidst the clamor of the day. With a mind as nimble as his fingers, he pondered the tasks before him. And so, with a determined spirit, he approached the brink of the unknown, raised his arms in defiance of the ordinary, and dove into the ethereal sky of digital expression. There, amidst a sea of code, his thoughts and memories swirled like eddies in a rushing stream. The chronicles of his journeys can be discovered at [here](https://github.com/guangxu-li/guangxuli-wiki).
