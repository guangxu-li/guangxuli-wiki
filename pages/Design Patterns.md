- [[#red]]==A design pattern should only be applied when the flexibility it affords is actually needed.==
- [[#blue]]==Design patterns== are descriptions of communicating ==objects and classes== that are customized to ==solve a general design problem== in a particular context.
- In general, a pattern has four essential elements:
    - Pattern name
    - Problem
      collapsed:: true
        - It describes when to apply the pattern
    - Solution
      collapsed:: true
        - It describes elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations
    - Consequences
      collapsed:: true
        - They're results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.
            - space and time trade-offs
            - impact on a system's flexibility, extensibility, or portability
