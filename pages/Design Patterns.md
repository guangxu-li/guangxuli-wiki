- Design patterns are descriptions of communicating <mark style='background-color:#bbfabb'>objects and classes</mark> that are customized to <mark style='background-color:#bbfabb'>solve a general design problem</mark> in a particular context.[1]([[64562a78-d32d-46cd-8c87-0353ddf6ff90]])
- In general, a pattern has four essential elements:[2]([[645628fa-f245-4e99-a0dd-36de6dd501d6]])
    - Pattern name
    - Problem
      collapsed:: true
        - It describes when to apply the pattern
    - Solution
      collapsed:: true
        - It describes elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations
    - Consequences
      collapsed:: true
        - They're results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.
            - space and time trade-offs
            - impact on a system's flexibility, extensibility, or portability
- ((64564a02-2d6d-4223-bab4-bc6fcb1ab7c6))
    - Purpose
        - [[Design Patterns/Creational]]
        - [[Design Patterns/Structural]]
        - [[Design Patterns/Behavioral]]
    - Scope[3]([[6479c53b-8334-438c-ba3c-b7f3b46c40c2]])
        - Class
            - Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and thei subclasses.
            - These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are **static**â€” fixed at compile-time.
        - Object
            - Object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more **dynamic**.
    - ((6479ec7c-14c0-4d13-8fab-096c812c128f))
- Design patterns solve the following design problems
    - Finding appropriate objects[4]([[6479ebf6-c88e-4385-b1b8-8651b3ecbd66]])
        - The hard part about object-oriented design is decomposing a system into objects[5]([[6479ebe3-b87b-41ed-a1a9-8bda0f052e20]])
        - Design patterns help to identify less-obvious abstractions and the objects that can capture them.[6]([[6479edc2-29d0-429d-b169-f04ffe6f2cfe]])
            - e.g. Objects that represent a process or algorithm don't occur in nature, yet they're crucial part of flexible designs.
    - Determining Object Granularity[7]([[6479edfb-19dd-4dd3-93a5-e95711fa44c1]])
    - Specifying Object Interfaces[8]([[6479f365-87c4-4b7e-be9c-11be20f44b06]])
        - Design patterns help to define interface by identifying key elements and kinds of data that get sent across an interface.[9]([[6479fa14-8332-4b87-8fe7-30c02d837dc1]])
        - Design patterns also specify relationships between interfaces.[10]([[6479fb5e-ed18-42aa-8f0c-b190f72b6c2a]])
    - Specifying Object Implementations[11]([[6479fb9f-2c07-499d-a59a-b51c316a00cc]])
    - Putting Reuse Mechanisms to Work[12]([[647a0265-55e2-4054-abf4-074aa55e3477]])
    - Relating Run-Time and Compile-Time Structures[13]([[647a0bd2-ac9a-43a1-b3f5-26170e1e177b]])
