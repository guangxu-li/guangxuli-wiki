- All read operations have the option of setting a watch as a side effect.
    - `getData()`, `getChildren()`, `exists()`
- One-time trigger: a watch is only triggered once
- Sent to the client.
    - Asynchronously.
    - Ordering guarantee: a client will never see a change for which it has set a watch until it first sees the watch even.
- The data for which the watch was set
    - Data watches
        - `getData()`, `exists()`
        - Return info about the data of the node
    - Child watches
        - `getChildren()`
        - Return a list of children
- Maintained locally at the ZooKeeper server.
    - When a client connects to a new server, the watch will be triggered for any session events.
    - Watches will not be received while disconnected from a server.
    - When a client reconnects, any previously registered watches will be reregistered and triggered if needed.
- Semantics of Watches
    - Created event: Enabled with a call to `exists`
    - Deleted event: Enabled with a call to `exists`, `getData`, and `getChildren`
    - Changed event: Enabled with a call to `exists` and `getData`
    - Child event: Enabled with a call to `getChildren`
- Persistent, Recursive Watches
    - *Added in v3.6.0*
    - **Not** One-time trigger, optionally, recursively watch all [[znodes]] starting at the znode that the watch is registered for.
    - Set by `addWatch()`
    - Remove by `removeWatches` with watcher type `WatcherType.Any`
- Guarantees
    - Watches are ordered.
    - Client will see the watch event before seeing the new data.
