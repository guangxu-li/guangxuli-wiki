- The essence of Tiny Habits:
    - Take a behavior you want, make it tiny, find where it fits naturally in your life, and nurture its growth.

- There are only three things we can do that will create lasting change:
    - Have an epiphany
        - Difficult and probably impossible
    - Change our environment
    - Change our habits in tiny ways
