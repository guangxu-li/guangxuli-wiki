    - Scope
        - Class
            - Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and thei subclasses.
            - These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are **static**â€” fixed at compile-time.
        - Object
            - Object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more **dynamic**.
