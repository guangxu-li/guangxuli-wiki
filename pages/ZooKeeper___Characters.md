        - Benefits
            - Why not follower?
                - To increase the whole system's read  performance by scaling out the followers, the write performance drops.
                - Due to the fact that a write operation requires the agreement of a [quorum]([[ZooKeeper/Quorum]]) of nodes.
                - The more followers, the more cost of voting is needed.
                - The observer is designed specifically for this problem.
            - Easy to scale without sacrificing the write and vote performance
            - Observers are okay to fail since they are non-voting members.
