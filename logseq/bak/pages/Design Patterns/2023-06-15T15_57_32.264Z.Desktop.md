- Design patterns are descriptions of communicating ==objects and classes== that are customized to ==solve a general design problem==in a particular context.
- In general, a pattern has four essential elements:
    - Pattern name
    - Problem
      collapsed:: true
        - It describes when to apply the pattern
    - Solution
      collapsed:: true
        - It describes elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations
    - Consequences
      collapsed:: true
        - They're results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.
            - space and time trade-offs
            - impact on a system's flexibility, extensibility, or portability

    - Scope
        - Class
            - Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and thei subclasses.
            - These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are **static**â€” fixed at compile-time.
        - Object
            - Object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more **dynamic**.
- Design pattern relationships

- Design patterns solve the following design problems
    - *Finding appropriate objects*
        - The hard part about object-oriented design is decomposing a system into objects
        - Design patterns help to identify less-obvious abstractions and the objects that can capture them.
            - e.g. Objects that represent a process or algorithm don't occur in nature, yet they're crucial part of flexible designs.
    - *Determining Object Granularity*
    - *Specifying Object Interfaces*
        - Design patterns help to define interface by identifying key elements and kinds of data that get sent across an interface.
        - Design patterns also specify relationships between interfaces.
    - *Specifying Object Implementations*
    - *Putting Reuse Mechanisms to Work*
    - *Relating Run-Time and Compile-Time Structures*
        - Many design patterns (in particular those that have object scope) capture the distinction between compile-time and run-time structures explicity.
    - *Designing for Change*
        - Creating an object by specifying a class explicitly.
            - It commits to a particular ==implementation== instead of a particular ==interface== ==which can complicate future changes==.
            - To avoid it, create objects indirectly.

        - Dependency on object representations or implementations.
            - Hiding dependencies' representations or implementations from clients keeps changes from cascading.

            - Algorithms that are likely to change should be isolated.

        - Tight coupling.
            - Design patterns use techniques such as abstract coupling and layering to promote loosely coupled systems.
