- ZooKeeper Consistency is achieved with the help of [[ZooKeeper/ZAB Protocol]].
  title:: ZooKeeper/Consistency
- ZooKeeper Consistency Guarantee
    - [[Ordered Sequential Consistency]][^1].
- Write operations in ZooKeeper
    - [[Linearizable]] .
    - The communication channels between leader and followers are [[FIFO Queue]].
- Read operations in ZooKeeper
    - **not** [[linearizable]].
        - Since a read in ZooKeeper is not a quorum operation and a server will response immediately to a client that is performing a read.
        - Prioritizes performance over consistency for the read use case.
    - [[Sequential Consistent]]
        - Because read operations will appear to take effect in some sequential order that furthermore respects the order of each client's operations.
        - Issue a [sync](((c4be6220-1321-4a46-9267-510ba19177de))) before issuing a read as a work around.
- Write-only: it guarantees [[linearizability]].
- Mix of read and write: it guarantees [[Sequential Consistency]] .
