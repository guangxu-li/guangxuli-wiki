- Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process.
    - **Class** creational patterns use **inheritance** to vary the class that's instantiated.
    - **Object** creational patterns delegate instantiation to another object.
- Two recurring themes in these patterns:
    - They all encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
        - All the system at large knows about the objects is their interfaces as defined by abstract classes.
    - They hide how instances of these classes are created and put together.
