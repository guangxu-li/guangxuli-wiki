- Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and thei subclasses. These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are staticâ€” fixed at compile-time. Object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic.

- The hard part about object-oriented design is decomposing a system into objects. The task is difficult because many factors come into play: encapsulation, granularity, dependency, flexibility, performance, evolution, reusability, and on and on. They all influence the decomposition, often in conflicting ways.

- But class inheritance has some disadvantages, too. First, you can't change the implementations inherited from parent classes at run-time, because inheritance is defined at compile-time. Second, and generally worse, parent classes often define at least part of their subclasses' physical representation. Because inheritance exposes a subclass to details of its parent's implementation, it's often said that "inheritance breaks encapsulation" [Sny86]. The implementation of a subclass becomes so bound up with the implementation of its parent class that any change in the parent's implementation will force the subclass to change.

- Because objects are accessed solely through their interfaces, we don't break encapsulation. Any object can be replaced at run-time by another as long as it has the same type. Moreover, because an object's implementation will be written in terms of object interfaces, there are substantially fewer implementation dependencies.

- Design patterns help you avoid this by ensuring that a system can change in specific ways. Each design pattern lets some aspect of system structure vary independently of other aspects, thereby making a system more robust to a particular kind of change. Here are some common causes of redesign along with the design pattern(s) that address them:

- Toolkit design is arguably harder than application design, because toolkits have to work in many applications to be useful. Moreover, the toolkit writer isn't in a position to know what those applications will be or their special needs. That makes it all the more important to avoid assumptions and dependencies that can limit the toolkit's flexibility and consequently its applicability and effectiveness.

- Clients generally can't tell whether they're dealing with the component or its enclosure(i.e., the child's parent), especially if the enclosure simply delegates all its operations to its component. But the enclosure can also augment the component's behavior by doing work of its own before and/or after delegating an operation. The enclosure can also effectively add state to the component.

- â€¢ a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed and represented.â€¢ a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.â€¢ a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.â€¢ you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal jus their interfaces, not their implementations.
